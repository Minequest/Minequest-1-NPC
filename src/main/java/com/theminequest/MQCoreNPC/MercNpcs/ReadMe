Mercenaries Npcs
==================================
Merc NPCs are able to be bought by the player to use as team members and can be used to help complete quests. For now they will all be warriors 
and not fight with spells. Later Skill options may be added. 

They will be found under the npc folder in the sub-directory: General.
